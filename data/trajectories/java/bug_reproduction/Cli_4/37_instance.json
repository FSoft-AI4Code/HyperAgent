{"system_prompt": "You are an expert in programming, you're so good at code navigation inside large repository. Try to combine different tools to seek related information to the query inside the project. Some good combinations of tools could be get_folder_structure -> find symbols of each file inside the directory. Semantic search -> exact code search -> go to definition and etc. If you know exactly the name of the symbol, you can use code_search tool or if you know the line and the name of the symbol, you can use go_to_definition tool. Try to avoid using open_file tool frequently (use the get all symbols instead). Respond to the human as helpfully and accurately as possible. Consider use other tools if the results returned is not cleared enough or failed for the query. If the final answer fully resolve the user query put solved word at the end of the answer. You have access to the following tools:\n\ncode_search: Useful when you want to find all matched identifiers (variable, function, class name) from a python repository, primarily used for class, function search. The results\n    are mixed and not sorted by any criteria. So considered using this when you want to find all possible candidates for a given name. Otherwise, consider using other tools for more precise results, args: {'names': {'title': 'Names', 'description': 'The names of the identifiers to search', 'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}}}\nSemantic Code Search: useful for when the query is a sentance, semantic and vague. If exact search such as code search failed after multiple tries, try this, args: {'tool_input': {'type': 'string'}}\ngo_to_definition: Useful when you want to find the definition of a symbol inside a code snippet if the current context is not cleared enough such as \n    0 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    1 class Directory(object):\n    2\n    3    def add_member(self, id, name):\n    4        self.members[id] = plt.figure() we might want to find the definition of plt.figure() invoke with params (\"figure\", 4, 'test.py'), args: {'word': {'title': 'Word', 'type': 'string'}, 'line': {'title': 'Line', 'type': 'integer'}, 'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'verbose': {'title': 'Verbose', 'default': True, 'type': 'boolean'}}\nfind_all_references: Given a code snippet that contains target symbol, find all references of this symbol inside the project.\n    , args: {'word': {'title': 'Word', 'type': 'string'}, 'line': {'title': 'Line', 'type': 'integer'}, 'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'reranking': {'title': 'Reranking', 'default': False, 'type': 'boolean'}, 'query': {'title': 'Query', 'default': '', 'type': 'string'}}\nget_all_symbols: Useful when you want to find all symbols (functions, classes, methods) of a python file, args: {'path_to_file': {'title': 'Path To File', 'type': 'string'}, 'preview_size': {'title': 'Preview Size', 'default': 5, 'type': 'integer'}}\nget_folder_structure: Useful when you want to explore the tree structure of a folder, good for initial exploration with knowing the parent folder name. Remember to provide the relative path correctly.\n    , args: {'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'level': {'title': 'Level', 'default': 2, 'type': 'integer'}}\nopen_file: Useful when you want to open a file inside a repo, use this tool only when it's very necessary, usually a main or server or training script. Consider combinining other alternative tools such as GetAllSymbols and CodeSearch to save the number of tokens for other cases., args: {'relative_file_path': {'title': 'Relative File Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'max_new_line': {'title': 'Max New Line', 'default': 500, 'type': 'integer'}}\n\nUse a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input).\n\nValid \"action\" values: \"Final Answer\" or code_search, Semantic Code Search, go_to_definition, find_all_references, get_all_symbols, get_folder_structure, open_file\n\nProvide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:\n\n```\n{\n  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,\n  \"action_input\": $INPUT\n}\n```\n\nFollow this format:\n\nQuestion: input question to answer\nThought: consider previous and subsequent steps, notes down some useful information (like code snippet) from observation\nAction:\n```\n$JSON_BLOB\n```\nObservation: action result\n...

To support **special**   \n\n(well I call them special anyway) like -Dsystem.property=value we need to be  \n\nable to examine the first character of an option. If the first character is  \n\nitself defined as an Option then the remainder of the token is used as the  \n\nvalue, e.g. 'D' is the token, it is an option so 'system.property=value' is the  \n\nargument value for that option. This is the behaviour that we are seeing for  \n\nyour example.   \n\n't' is the token, it is an options so 'arget' is the argument value. \n\n\nI suppose a solution to this could be to have a way to specify properties for  \n\nparsers. In this case 'posix.special.option == true' for turning   \n\non **special** options. I'll have a look into this and let you know.\n\n\nJust to keep track of this and to get you used to how we operate, can you log a  \n\nbug in bugzilla for this.\n\n\nThanks,  \n\n-John K\n\n\n\n    \n\nPrevious steps: steps=[]\n\nCurrent objective: value=\"Use the open_file tool to open the test file related to the PosixParser class in the repository, which is likely to be found in the 'src/test' directory.\"\n\nThis was your previous work (but I haven't seen any of it!

Since the test class for `PosixParser` is not found directly, I will attempt to find the test directory and then search for any test files related to `PosixParser`.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"get_folder_structure\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"relative_path\": \"src/test\",\n    \"level\": 1\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\nObservation: The tree structure of src/test is: \ntest\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 data\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 org\n\n2 directories\nThought:The `src/test` directory contains two subdirectories: `data` and `org`. It is common for Java projects to place their test classes within a package structure that mirrors the main source code. Since `PosixParser` is likely to be part of the Apache Commons CLI project, the test class might be located under the `org` directory, following the package naming convention.\n\nI will now look into the `org` directory to find the test class related to `PosixParser`.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"get_folder_structure\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"relative_path\": \"src/test/org\",\n    \"level\": 3\n  }\n}\n```\nObservation: The tree structure of src/test/org is: \norg\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 apache\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 commons\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 cli\n\n3 directories\nThought:The test classes for the Apache Commons CLI project are likely to be located within the `org/apache/commons/cli` directory.
