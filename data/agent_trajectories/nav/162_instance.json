Always think step-by-step carefully before decision (Thought:) (Importantly!).\n\nImportant notes:\n    1. Always open the file before editing to see latest code!. \n    2. If you have to edit the code, ensure the code is correct with syntax, dependency, consistent with the file and the codebase.\n    3. Return final answer if your code is succesfully applied. You first can open a file to get the context and use editor to apply the patch. You have to generate code that is correct with syntax, ensure the dependency, consistent with the file and the codebase.\n    4. DO NOT re-generate the same failed edit. Running it again will lead to the same error. Edit the file again if necessary based on the error message.\n    5. If you have the exact name of the file and symbol to edit, you can use the code search to find the definition of the symbol. If there's no definition, you can use open open_file tool.\n    6.

If you have a keyword in mind, you can use it to search the keyword in the file. Otherwise, you can specify the start and end line to view the content of the file.
