{"system_prompt": "You are an expert in programming, you're so good at code navigation inside large repository. Try to combine different tools to seek related information to the query inside the project. Some good combinations of tools could be get_folder_structure -> find symbols of each file inside the directory. Semantic search -> exact code search -> go to definition and etc. If you know exactly the name of the symbol, you can use code_search tool or if you know the line and the name of the symbol, you can use go_to_definition tool. Try to avoid using open_file tool frequently (use the get all symbols instead). Respond to the human as helpfully and accurately as possible. Consider use other tools if the results returned is not cleared enough or failed for the query. You have access to the following tools:\n\ncode_search: Useful when you want to find all matched identifiers (variable, function, class name) from a python repository, primarily used for class, function search. The results\n    are mixed and not sorted by any criteria. So considered using this when you want to find all possible candidates for a given name. Otherwise, consider using other tools for more precise results, args: {'names': {'title': 'Names', 'description': 'The names of the identifiers to search', 'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}}}\nSemantic Code Search: useful for when the query is a sentance, semantic and vague. If exact search such as code search failed after multiple tries, try this, args: {'tool_input': {'type': 'string'}}\ngo_to_definition: Useful when you want to find the definition of a symbol inside a code snippet if the current context is not cleared enough such as \n    0 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    1 class Directory(object):\n    2\n    3    def add_member(self, id, name):\n    4        self.members[id] = plt.figure() we might want to find the definition of plt.figure() invoke with params (\"figure\", 4, 'test.py'), args: {'word': {'title': 'Word', 'type': 'string'}, 'line': {'title': 'Line', 'type': 'integer'}, 'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}}\nfind_all_references: Given a code snippet that contains target symbol, find all references of this symbol inside the project.\n    , args: {'word': {'title': 'Word', 'type': 'string'}, 'line': {'title': 'Line', 'type': 'integer'}, 'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'reranking': {'title': 'Reranking', 'default': False, 'type': 'boolean'}, 'query': {'title': 'Query', 'default': '', 'type': 'string'}}\nget_all_symbols: Useful when you want to find all symbols (functions, classes, methods) of a python file, args: {'path_to_file': {'title': 'Path To File', 'type': 'string'}, 'preview_size': {'title': 'Preview Size', 'default': 5, 'type': 'integer'}}\nget_folder_structure: Useful when you want to explore the tree structure of a folder, good for initial exploration with knowing the parent folder name. Remember to provide the relative path correctly.\n    , args: {'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'level': {'title': 'Level', 'default': 2, 'type': 'integer'}}\nopen_file: Useful when you want to open a file inside a repo, use this tool only when it's very necessary, usually a main or server or training script. Consider combinining other alternative tools such as GetAllSymbols and CodeSearch to save the number of tokens for other cases., args: {'relative_file_path': {'title': 'Relative File Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'max_new_line': {'title': 'Max New Line', 'default': 500, 'type': 'integer'}}\n\nUse a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input).\n\nValid \"action\" values: \"Final Answer\" or code_search, Semantic Code Search, go_to_definition, find_all_references, get_all_symbols, get_folder_structure, open_file\n\nProvide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:\n\n```\n{\n  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,\n  \"action_input\": $INPUT\n}\n```\n\nFollow this format:\n\nQuestion: input question to answer\nThought: consider previous and subsequent steps, notes down some useful information (like code snippet) from observation\nAction:\n```\n$JSON_BLOB\n```\nObservation: action result\n...

However, the snippets are out of context and do not provide a clear explanation of how tiktoken speeds up the process. To gain a better understanding, I will use the `find_all_references` tool on the symbol `tokens` to find more context in the codebase where tokenization is handled.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"find_all_references\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"word\": \"tokens\",\n    \"line\": 0,\n    \"relative_path\": \"\",\n    \"reranking\": true\n  }\n}\n```\nObservation: []\nThought:The attempt to find all references to the symbol `tokens` did not yield any results, which suggests that either the symbol `tokens` is not present in the codebase, or the provided context was insufficient for the tool to locate the references.\n\nGiven that the semantic search provided snippets that are related to the tokenization process but lacked context, and the `find_all_references` tool did not return results, it may be beneficial to explore the repository structure to identify modules or files that are likely to be related to the tokenization process. This could help narrow down the search to specific areas of the codebase where the tokenization logic is implemented.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"get_folder_structure\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"relative_path\": \"\",\n    \"level\": 2\n  }\n}\n```\nObservation: The tree structure of  is: \nrepo__openai__tiktoken__commit__\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .git\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 info\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 description\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 hooks\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 branches\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 refs\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 HEAD\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 config\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 objects\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 packed-refs\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 logs\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ORIG_HEAD\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .github\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 workflows\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 CHANGELOG.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.toml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 MANIFEST.in\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 perf.svg\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pyproject.toml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 benchmark.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 redact.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib.rs\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tests\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_encoding.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_helpers.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_misc.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_offsets.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_simple_public.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tiktoken\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 _educational.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 core.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 load.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 model.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 py.typed\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 registry.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 tiktoken_ext\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 openai_public.py\n\n14 directories, 32 files\nThought:The folder structure reveals that there is a directory named `tiktoken` which likely contains the core functionality of the tiktoken library.
