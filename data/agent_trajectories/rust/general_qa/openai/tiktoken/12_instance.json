{"system_prompt": "You are an expert in programming, you're so good at code navigation inside large repository. Try to combine different tools to seek related information to the query inside the project. Some good combinations of tools could be get_folder_structure -> find symbols of each file inside the directory. Semantic search -> exact code search -> go to definition and etc. If you know exactly the name of the symbol, you can use code_search tool or if you know the line and the name of the symbol, you can use go_to_definition tool. Try to avoid using open_file tool frequently (use the get all symbols instead). Respond to the human as helpfully and accurately as possible. Consider use other tools if the results returned is not cleared enough or failed for the query. You have access to the following tools:\n\ncode_search: Useful when you want to find all matched identifiers (variable, function, class name) from a python repository, primarily used for class, function search. The results\n    are mixed and not sorted by any criteria. So considered using this when you want to find all possible candidates for a given name. Otherwise, consider using other tools for more precise results, args: {'names': {'title': 'Names', 'description': 'The names of the identifiers to search', 'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}}}\nSemantic Code Search: useful for when the query is a sentance, semantic and vague. If exact search such as code search failed after multiple tries, try this, args: {'tool_input': {'type': 'string'}}\ngo_to_definition: Useful when you want to find the definition of a symbol inside a code snippet if the current context is not cleared enough such as \n    0 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    1 class Directory(object):\n    2\n    3    def add_member(self, id, name):\n    4        self.members[id] = plt.figure() we might want to find the definition of plt.figure() invoke with params (\"figure\", 4, 'test.py'), args: {'word': {'title': 'Word', 'type': 'string'}, 'line': {'title': 'Line', 'type': 'integer'}, 'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}}\nfind_all_references: Given a code snippet that contains target symbol, find all references of this symbol inside the project.\n    , args: {'word': {'title': 'Word', 'type': 'string'}, 'line': {'title': 'Line', 'type': 'integer'}, 'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'reranking': {'title': 'Reranking', 'default': False, 'type': 'boolean'}, 'query': {'title': 'Query', 'default': '', 'type': 'string'}}\nget_all_symbols: Useful when you want to find all symbols (functions, classes, methods) of a python file, args: {'path_to_file': {'title': 'Path To File', 'type': 'string'}, 'preview_size': {'title': 'Preview Size', 'default': 5, 'type': 'integer'}}\nget_folder_structure: Useful when you want to explore the tree structure of a folder, good for initial exploration with knowing the parent folder name. Remember to provide the relative path correctly.\n    , args: {'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'level': {'title': 'Level', 'default': 2, 'type': 'integer'}}\nopen_file: Useful when you want to open a file inside a repo, use this tool only when it's very necessary, usually a main or server or training script.

However, the snippets are out of context and do not provide a clear explanation of how tiktoken speeds up the process. To get a better understanding, it would be beneficial to find the definitions of the functions mentioned in the snippets, such as `_decode_native` and `byte_pair_encode`, as well as any relevant comments or documentation that might be associated with them.\n\nAction:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"code_search\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"names\": [\"_decode_native\", \"byte_pair_encode\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nObservation: {'_decode_native': [{'file': 'src/lib.rs', 'name': '_decode_native', 'documentation': '', 'implementation': '194 fn _decode_native(&self, tokens: &[usize]) -> Vec<u8> {\\n195         let mut ret = Vec::with_capacity(tokens.len() * 2);\\n196         for token in tokens {\\n197             let token_bytes = self\\n198                 .decoder\\n199                 .get(token)\\n200                 .unwrap_or_else(|| &self.special_tokens_decoder[token]);\\n201             ret.extend(token_bytes);\\n202         }\\n203         ret\\n204     }'}], 'byte_pair_encode': [{'file': 'src/lib.rs', 'name': 'byte_pair_encode', 'documentation': '', 'implementation': '99 pub fn byte_pair_encode(piece: &[u8], ranks: &HashMap<Vec<u8>, usize>) -> Vec<usize> {\\n100     if piece.len() == 1 {\\n101         return vec![ranks[piece]];\\n102     }\\n103     _byte_pair_merge(piece, ranks, |p| ranks[&piece[p.start..p.end]])\\n104 }'}]}\nThought:The code search results provide the implementations of `_decode_native` and `byte_pair_encode` functions from the `src/lib.rs` file. The `_decode_native` function takes a slice of tokens and decodes them into a vector of bytes, while the `byte_pair_encode` function encodes a piece of bytes using a hashmap of ranks. Both functions seem to be core to the tokenization process, with `_decode_native` likely being used for decoding tokens into text and `byte_pair_encode` for encoding text into tokens.\n\nThe `_decode_native` function is optimized by pre-allocating memory with `Vec::with_capacity(tokens.len() * 2)` and using a loop to extend the vector with the bytes of each token. This suggests that memory allocation is done efficiently to avoid frequent reallocations.\n\nThe `byte_pair_encode` function uses a helper function `_byte_pair_merge` and a hashmap to quickly find the rank of each byte pair, which indicates that the encoding process is optimized for speed by using efficient data structures like hashmaps.\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive answer, it would be helpful to look at the `_byte_pair_merge` function and any comments or documentation that might explain how these functions contribute to speeding up the tokenization process.\n\nAction:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"code_search\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"names\": [\"_byte_pair_merge\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nObservation: {'_byte_pair_merge': [{'file': 'src/lib.rs', 'name': '_byte_pair_merge', 'documentation': '', 'implementation': '13 fn _byte_pair_merge<T>(\\n14     piece: &[u8],\\n15     ranks: &HashMap<Vec<u8>, usize>,\\n16     f: impl Fn(std::ops::Range<usize>) -> T,\\n17 ) -> Vec<T> {\\n18     // This is a vector of (start, rank).\\n19     // The rank is of the byte pair starting at position start.\\n20     // The rank of the last item in the vector is not a valid value.\\n21     let mut parts: Vec<(usize, usize)> = (0..piece.len() + 1).map(|i| (i, usize::MAX)).collect();\\n22 \\n23     let get_rank = {\\n24         #[inline(always)]\\n25         |parts: &Vec<(usize, usize)>, start_idx: usize, skip: usize| {\\n26             if (start_idx + skip + 2) < parts.len() {\\n27                 ranks\\n28                     .get(&piece[parts[start_idx].0..parts[start_idx + skip + 2].0])\\n29                     .copied()\\n30             } else {\\n31                 None\\n32             }\\n33         }\\n34     };\\n35 \\n36     // We look up the ranks once in the beginning and iteratively update\\n37     // them during each merge, which reduces the number of rank lookups.\\n38     for i in 0..parts.len() - 2 {\\n39         match get_rank(&parts, i, 0) {\\n40             Some(rank) => {\\n41                 // usize::MAX is a sentinel value and cannot be a valid rank\\n42                 debug_assert!(rank != usize::MAX);\\n43                 parts[i].1 = rank;\\n44             }\\n45             None => {\\n46                 continue;\\n47             }\\n48         };\\n49     }\\n50 \\n51     // If you have n parts and m merges, this does O(mn) work.\\n52     // We could do something with a heap and do O(m log n) work.\\n53     // It is important to consider that n is often small (<100), and as such\\n54     // the cache-locality benefits outweigh the algorithmic complexity downsides\\n55     // of the `parts` vector data structure above.\\n56 \\n57     // Note that we hash bytes, not token pairs.

It uses inline annotations (`#[inline(always)]`) to suggest to the compiler that the function should be inlined to improve performance.\n2.
