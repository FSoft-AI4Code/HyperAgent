{"system_prompt": "You are an expert in programming, you're so good at code navigation inside large repository. Try to combine different tools to seek related information to the query inside the project. Some good combinations of tools could be get_folder_structure -> find symbols of each file inside the directory. Semantic search -> exact code search -> go to definition and etc. If you know exactly the name of the symbol, you can use code_search tool or if you know the line and the name of the symbol, you can use go_to_definition tool. Try to avoid using open_file tool frequently (use the get all symbols instead). Respond to the human as helpfully and accurately as possible. Consider use other tools if the results returned is not cleared enough or failed for the query. If the final answer fully resolve the user query put solved word at the end of the answer. You have access to the following tools:\n\ncode_search: Useful when you want to find all matched identifiers (variable, function, class name) from a python repository, primarily used for class, function search. The results\n    are mixed and not sorted by any criteria. So considered using this when you want to find all possible candidates for a given name. Otherwise, consider using other tools for more precise results, args: {'names': {'title': 'Names', 'description': 'The names of the identifiers to search', 'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}}}\nSemantic Code Search: useful for when the query is a sentance, semantic and vague. If exact search such as code search failed after multiple tries, try this, args: {'tool_input': {'type': 'string'}}\ngo_to_definition: Useful when you want to find the definition of a symbol inside a code snippet if the current context is not cleared enough such as \n    0 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    1 class Directory(object):\n    2\n    3    def add_member(self, id, name):\n    4        self.members[id] = plt.figure() we might want to find the definition of plt.figure() invoke with params (\"figure\", 4, 'test.py'), args: {'word': {'title': 'Word', 'type': 'string'}, 'line': {'title': 'Line', 'type': 'integer'}, 'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'verbose': {'title': 'Verbose', 'default': True, 'type': 'boolean'}}\nfind_all_references: Given a code snippet that contains target symbol, find all references of this symbol inside the project.\n    , args: {'word': {'title': 'Word', 'type': 'string'}, 'line': {'title': 'Line', 'type': 'integer'}, 'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'reranking': {'title': 'Reranking', 'default': False, 'type': 'boolean'}, 'query': {'title': 'Query', 'default': '', 'type': 'string'}}\nget_all_symbols: Useful when you want to find all symbols (functions, classes, methods) of a python file, args: {'path_to_file': {'title': 'Path To File', 'type': 'string'}, 'preview_size': {'title': 'Preview Size', 'default': 5, 'type': 'integer'}}\nget_folder_structure: Useful when you want to explore the tree structure of a folder, good for initial exploration with knowing the parent folder name. Remember to provide the relative path correctly.\n    , args: {'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'level': {'title': 'Level', 'default': 2, 'type': 'integer'}}\nopen_file: Useful when you want to open a file inside a repo, use this tool only when it's very necessary, usually a main or server or training script. Consider combinining other alternative tools such as GetAllSymbols and CodeSearch to save the number of tokens for other cases., args: {'relative_file_path': {'title': 'Relative File Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'max_new_line': {'title': 'Max New Line', 'default': 500, 'type': 'integer'}}\n\nUse a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input).\n\nValid \"action\" values: \"Final Answer\" or code_search, Semantic Code Search, go_to_definition, find_all_references, get_all_symbols, get_folder_structure, open_file\n\nProvide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:\n\n```\n{\n  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,\n  \"action_input\": $INPUT\n}\n```\n\nFollow this format:\n\nQuestion: input question to answer\nThought: consider previous and subsequent steps, notes down some useful information (like code snippet) from observation\nAction:\n```\n$JSON_BLOB\n```\nObservation: action result\n...

To support **special**   \n\n(well I call them special anyway) like -Dsystem.property=value we need to be  \n\nable to examine the first character of an option. If the first character is  \n\nitself defined as an Option then the remainder of the token is used as the  \n\nvalue, e.g. 'D' is the token, it is an option so 'system.property=value' is the  \n\nargument value for that option. This is the behaviour that we are seeing for  \n\nyour example.   \n\n't' is the token, it is an options so 'arget' is the argument value. \n\n\nI suppose a solution to this could be to have a way to specify properties for  \n\nparsers. In this case 'posix.special.option == true' for turning   \n\non **special** options. I'll have a look into this and let you know.\n\n\nJust to keep track of this and to get you used to how we operate, can you log a  \n\nbug in bugzilla for this.\n\n\nThanks,  \n\n-John K\n\n\n\n    \n\nPrevious steps: steps=[(Step(value=\"Use the open_file tool to open the test file related to the PosixParser class in the repository, which is likely to be located in the 'src/test' directory.\"), StepResponse(response=\"It appears that there is no existing test case in the repository that matches the failure behavior described in the bug report for the PosixParser.

However, there is no specific mention of a `PosixParserTest.java` or similar file that would directly indicate the presence of tests for the `PosixParser` class.\n\nGiven that there is a `BugsTest.java` file, it is possible that this file contains test cases for various bugs found in the library, including potentially the one described in the bug report. To confirm this and to find the appropriate place to add the new test case, we should examine the contents of `BugsTest.java`.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"get_all_symbols\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"path_to_file\": \"src/test/org/apache/commons/cli/BugsTest.java\",\n    \"preview_size\": 5\n  }\n}\n```\n\nObservation: [\"Name: BugsTest\\nType: Class\\nPreview: 28 public class BugsTest extends TestCase\\n29 {\\n30     /** CommandLine instance */\\n31     private CommandLine _cmdline = null;\\n32     private Option _option = null;\\nDocumentation: {'language': 'java', 'value': 'org.apache.commons.cli.BugsTest'}\"]\nThought:", "system_response": "The observation confirms that `BugsTest.java` is a class extending `TestCase`, which is typical for JUnit test classes. This class likely contains test methods for various bugs. To write a new test case that reproduces the failure behavior described in the bug report, we would need to add a new test method to this class.\n\nThe test method should create an instance of `PosixParser`, define the options with both short and long names, parse a command line that includes the `-target foobar.com` option, and assert that the value for the target option is correctly parsed as `foobar.com` instead of `arget`.\n\nSince I do not have the ability to write code directly, I will provide a description of what the test case should look like:\n\n1. Create a new test method annotated with `@Test`.\n2. Instantiate a `PosixParser` object.\n3. Define an `Options` object and add an `Option` with short name \"t\" and long name \"target\".\n4. Parse the command line arguments using the `PosixParser`.\n5. Assert that the value for the option \"t\" or \"target\" is \"foobar.com\".\n\nHere is a conceptual example of what the test method might look like in Java:\n\n```java\n@Test\npublic void testPosixParserShouldNotTruncateOptionValue() {\n    PosixParser parser = new PosixParser();\n    Options options = new Options();\n    Option target = new Option(\"t\", \"target\", true, \"description\");\n    options.addOption(target);\n\n    String[] args = new String[]{\"-target\", \"foobar.com\"};\n    CommandLine cmd = parser.parse(options, args);\n\n    assertEquals(\"foobar.com\", cmd.getOptionValue(\"t\"));\n}\n```\n\nThis test case should be added to the `BugsTest.java` file within the appropriate test suite. If the test fails, it would indicate that the bug is reproducible with the current implementation of `PosixParser`.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"Final Answer\",\n  \"action_input\": \"The test case should be added to the `BugsTest.java` file. It should instantiate a `PosixParser`, define an `Option` with short name 't' and long name 'target', parse the command line arguments, and assert that the value for the option is 'foobar.com'.
