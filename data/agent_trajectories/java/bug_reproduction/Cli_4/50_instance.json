{"system_prompt": "You are an expert in programming, you're so good at code navigation inside large repository. Try to combine different tools to seek related information to the query inside the project. Some good combinations of tools could be get_folder_structure -> find symbols of each file inside the directory. Semantic search -> exact code search -> go to definition and etc. If you know exactly the name of the symbol, you can use code_search tool or if you know the line and the name of the symbol, you can use go_to_definition tool. Try to avoid using open_file tool frequently (use the get all symbols instead). Respond to the human as helpfully and accurately as possible. Consider use other tools if the results returned is not cleared enough or failed for the query. If the final answer fully resolve the user query put solved word at the end of the answer. You have access to the following tools:\n\ncode_search: Useful when you want to find all matched identifiers (variable, function, class name) from a python repository, primarily used for class, function search. The results\n    are mixed and not sorted by any criteria. So considered using this when you want to find all possible candidates for a given name. Otherwise, consider using other tools for more precise results, args: {'names': {'title': 'Names', 'description': 'The names of the identifiers to search', 'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}}}\nSemantic Code Search: useful for when the query is a sentance, semantic and vague. If exact search such as code search failed after multiple tries, try this, args: {'tool_input': {'type': 'string'}}\ngo_to_definition: Useful when you want to find the definition of a symbol inside a code snippet if the current context is not cleared enough such as \n    0 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    1 class Directory(object):\n    2\n    3    def add_member(self, id, name):\n    4        self.members[id] = plt.figure() we might want to find the definition of plt.figure() invoke with params (\"figure\", 4, 'test.py'), args: {'word': {'title': 'Word', 'type': 'string'}, 'line': {'title': 'Line', 'type': 'integer'}, 'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'verbose': {'title': 'Verbose', 'default': True, 'type': 'boolean'}}\nfind_all_references: Given a code snippet that contains target symbol, find all references of this symbol inside the project.\n    , args: {'word': {'title': 'Word', 'type': 'string'}, 'line': {'title': 'Line', 'type': 'integer'}, 'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'reranking': {'title': 'Reranking', 'default': False, 'type': 'boolean'}, 'query': {'title': 'Query', 'default': '', 'type': 'string'}}\nget_all_symbols: Useful when you want to find all symbols (functions, classes, methods) of a python file, args: {'path_to_file': {'title': 'Path To File', 'type': 'string'}, 'preview_size': {'title': 'Preview Size', 'default': 5, 'type': 'integer'}}\nget_folder_structure: Useful when you want to explore the tree structure of a folder, good for initial exploration with knowing the parent folder name. Remember to provide the relative path correctly.\n    , args: {'relative_path': {'title': 'Relative Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'level': {'title': 'Level', 'default': 2, 'type': 'integer'}}\nopen_file: Useful when you want to open a file inside a repo, use this tool only when it's very necessary, usually a main or server or training script. Consider combinining other alternative tools such as GetAllSymbols and CodeSearch to save the number of tokens for other cases., args: {'relative_file_path': {'title': 'Relative File Path', 'type': 'string'}, 'max_new_line': {'title': 'Max New Line', 'default': 500, 'type': 'integer'}}\n\nUse a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input).\n\nValid \"action\" values: \"Final Answer\" or code_search, Semantic Code Search, go_to_definition, find_all_references, get_all_symbols, get_folder_structure, open_file\n\nProvide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:\n\n```\n{\n  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,\n  \"action_input\": $INPUT\n}\n```\n\nFollow this format:\n\nQuestion: input question to answer\nThought: consider previous and subsequent steps, notes down some useful information (like code snippet) from observation\nAction:\n```\n$JSON_BLOB\n```\nObservation: action result\n...

This is the behaviour that we are seeing for  \n\nyour example.   \n\n't' is the token, it is an options so 'arget' is the argument value. \n\n\nI suppose a solution to this could be to have a way to specify properties for  \n\nparsers.

This could potentially contain the test cases related to bugs, including the one for `PosixParser`. However, there is also a `BugsTest.java` file directly under the `cli` directory, which might also contain relevant test cases.\n\nTo determine the correct location for the `PosixParser` test case, we should first check the `BugsTest.java` file, as it is common to place tests related to bugs in a file with such a name. If we do not find the relevant test case there, we can then explore the `bug` directory.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"get_all_symbols\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"path_to_file\": \"src/test/org/apache/commons/cli/BugsTest.java\"\n  }\n}\n```\nObservation: [\"Name: BugsTest\\nType: Class\\nPreview: 28 public class BugsTest extends TestCase\\n29 {\\n30     /** CommandLine instance */\\n31     private CommandLine _cmdline = null;\\n32     private Option _option = null;\\nDocumentation: {'language': 'java', 'value': 'org.apache.commons.cli.BugsTest'}\"]\nThought:The `BugsTest.java` file is a class that extends `TestCase`, which is typical for JUnit test classes. This file is likely to contain the test cases for various bugs found in the `commons-cli` project. To find a test case related to the `PosixParser` issue described in the bug report, we should search for a method within `BugsTest.java` that might be related to the `PosixParser` or the described behavior.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"code_search\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"names\": [\"PosixParser\"]\n  }\n}\n```\nObservation: {'PosixParser': []}\nThought:The code search for \"PosixParser\" returned no results, which suggests that there might not be a direct reference to \"PosixParser\" in the `BugsTest.java` file or it might be referenced in a different way. Since we are looking for a test case that reproduces the failure behavior described in the bug report, we should look for test methods that might be related to command line parsing or options handling, as these are the functionalities affected by the bug.\n\nWe can try searching for test methods that might be related to the bug by looking for terms like \"option\", \"parse\", or \"command line\" within the `BugsTest.java` file.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"code_search\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"names\": [\"option\", \"parse\", \"command line\"]\n  }\n}\n```\nObservation: {'option': [], 'parse': [], 'command line': []}\nThought:The code search for \"option\", \"parse\", and \"command line\" also returned no results. This could mean that the test case for the `PosixParser` issue is not present in the `BugsTest.java` file or that the test case does not directly reference these terms. Given that we have a `bug` directory under `src/test/org/apache/commons/cli`, it is possible that the test case we are looking for is located there.\n\nWe should explore the `bug` directory next to see if it contains a test file specifically for the `PosixParser` issue.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"get_folder_structure\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"relative_path\": \"src/test/org/apache/commons/cli/bug\",\n    \"level\": 1\n  }\n}\n```\nObservation: The tree structure of src/test/org/apache/commons/cli/bug is: \nbug\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BugCLI13Test.java\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BugCLI18Test.java\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 BugCLI51Test.java\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 BugCLI71Test.java\n\n0 directories, 4 files\nThought:The `bug` directory contains several test files named after specific bug identifiers (e.g., `BugCLI13Test.java`, `BugCLI18Test.java`, etc.). Since the bug report provided does not include a specific identifier, we cannot directly match the bug to one of these files. However, we can inspect each of these test files to see if any of them contain a test case that reproduces the failure behavior described in the bug report.\n\nWe should start by examining the symbols in each of these test files to identify any test methods that might be related to the `PosixParser` issue.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"get_all_symbols\",\n  \"action_input\": {\n    \"path_to_file\": \"src/test/org/apache/commons/cli/bug/BugCLI13Test.java\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nObservation: ['Name: BugCLI13Test\\nType: Class\\nPreview: 26 /**\\n27  * @author brianegge\\n28  */\\n29 public class BugCLI13Test\\n30     extends TestCase\\n31 {\\n32     public void testCLI13()\\n33         throws ParseException\\n34     {\\nDocumentation: None']\nThought:The `BugCLI13Test.java` file contains a class that extends `TestCase`, which indicates it's a JUnit test class.
