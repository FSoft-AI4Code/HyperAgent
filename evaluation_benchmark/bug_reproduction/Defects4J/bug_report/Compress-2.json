{"issue_id": "COMPRESS-11", "title": "Ar doesn't delete correct", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>When working on the Testcases i figured out that a deletion from an Ar Archive is not as successful as it look at first glance.<br/>\nFor example: my bla.ar file contains test1.xml and test2.xml. I delete test2.xml</p>\n<p>The \"getNextEntry\" Method just delivers test1.xml. Looks correct.</p>\n<p>But checking the result file at commandline brings the following:</p>\n<p>$&gt; ar -t /tmp/dir26673/bla.ar<br/>\ntest1.xml<br/>\ntest2.xml</p>\n<p>vi shows me that there is still the test2.xml entry in the archive,<br/>\neven when getNextEntry returns null.</p>\n<p>Deleting test2.xml and adding test.txt afterward brings the following:</p>\n<p>$&gt; ar -t /tmp/dir24825/bla.ar<br/>\ntest.txt<br/>\nar: /tmp/dir24825/bla.ar: Inappropriate file type or format</p>\n</div>\n"}
