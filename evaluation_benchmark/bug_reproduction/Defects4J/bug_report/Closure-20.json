{"issue_id": "759", "title": "String conversion optimization is incorrect", "description": "<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n\r\nvar f = {\r\n  valueOf: function() { return undefined; }\r\n}\r\nString(f)\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nExpected output: &quot;[object Object]&quot;\r\nActual output: &quot;undefined&quot;\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n\r\nAll versions (http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/ as well).\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nThe compiler optimizes String(x) calls by replacing them with x + ''. This is correct in most cases, but incorrect in corner cases like the one mentioned above."}
