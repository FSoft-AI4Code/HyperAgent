{"issue_id": "MATH-938", "title": "Line.revert() is imprecise", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>Line.revert() only maintains ~10 digits for the direction. This becomes an issue when the line's position is evaluated far from the origin. A simple fix would be to use Vector3D.negate() for the direction.</p>\n<p>Also, is there a reason why Line is not immutable? It is just comprised of two vectors.</p>\n</div>\n"}
