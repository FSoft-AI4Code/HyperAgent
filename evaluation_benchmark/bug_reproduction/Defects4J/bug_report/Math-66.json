{"issue_id": "MATH-395", "title": "Bugs in \"BrentOptimizer\"", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>I apologize for having provided a buggy implementation of Brent's optimization algorithm (class \"BrentOptimizer\" in package \"optimization.univariate\").<br/>\nThe unit tests didn't show that there was something wrong, although (from the \"changes.xml\" file) I discovered that, at the time, Luc had noticed something weird in the implementation's behaviour.<br/>\nComparing with an implementation in Python, I could figure out the fixes. I'll modify \"BrentOptimizer\" and add a test. I also propose to change the name of the unit test class from \"BrentMinimizerTest\" to \"BrentOptimizerTest\".</p>\n</div>\n"}
