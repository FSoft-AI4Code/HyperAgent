{"issue_id": "184", "title": "siblingElements in Element throws Null Pointer Exception", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">Hi,</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I have noticed that the sibling methods (nextSibling, previousSibling, siblingElements) rely on an element (underlying node) having a parent. If the node does not have a parent it throws null pointer exception.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Would it be possible to modify the code so that it checks for parent nullness around Node.java:468?</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In the event of nullness return null as in the javadoc?</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Confirmed in 1.6.2</p>\n"}
