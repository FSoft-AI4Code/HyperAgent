{"issue_id": "487", "title": "Column-indicating caret is sometimes not in error output", "description": "For some reason, the caret doesn't always show up in the output when there are errors.\r\n\r\nWhen test.js looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;alert(1;\r\n\r\n\r\n, the output is this:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;java -jar compiler.jar --js test.js\r\ntest.js:1: ERROR - Parse error. missing ) after argument list\r\n\r\n1 error(s), 0 warning(s)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, when test.js looks like this (notice the line break after the semicolon):\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;alert(1;\r\n&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n, the output is this:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;java -jar compiler.jar --js test.js\r\ntest.js:1: ERROR - Parse error. missing ) after argument list\r\nalert(1;\r\n        ^\r\n\r\n1 error(s), 0 warning(s)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's the simplest reproduction of the problem that I could come up with, but I just encountered the problem in a file with ~100 LOC in it. This is the first time I believe I've run into the problem, but when it happens, my error parser fails and it becomes a pain to track down the raw output to find the actual problem.\r\n\r\nTested against r1171, committed 6/10 08:06. The problem is present going back to at least r1000, so this isn't a new issue."}
