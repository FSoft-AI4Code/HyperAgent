{"issue_id": "246", "title": "Fix UTF8JsonGenerator to allow QUOTE_FIELD_NAMES to be toggled.", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">Thank you for contributing this! I ended up merging it in slightly modified form, partly since I wanted it backported in 2.7, and master is now for 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT, and partly to refactor to make char-backed output also use same mechanism. Fix will be included in 2.7.2 to be released soon.</p>\n"}
