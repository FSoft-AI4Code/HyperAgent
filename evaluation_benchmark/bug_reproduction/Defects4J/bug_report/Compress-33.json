{"issue_id": "COMPRESS-316", "title": "CompressorStreamFactory doesn't handle deflate streams with a zlib header", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>If you take a zlib / deflate compressed file, with the zlib header (eg the test file bla.tar.deflatez) and pass it to CompressorStreamFactory.createCompressorInputStream, it won't be detected and you'll get a CompressorException(\"No Compressor found for the stream signature.\")</p>\n<p>While detecting header-less zlib files is probably too tricky to manage, those with the header ought to be possible to spot and handle</p>\n</div>\n"}
