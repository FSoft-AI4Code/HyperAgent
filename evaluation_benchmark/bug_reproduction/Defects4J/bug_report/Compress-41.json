{"issue_id": "COMPRESS-367", "title": "ZipArchiveInputStream.getNextZipEntry() should differentiate between \"invalid entry encountered\" and \"no more entries\"", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>ZipArchiveInputStream.getNextZipEntry() currently returns null if an invalid entry is encountered.  Thus, it's not possible to differentiate between \"no more entries\" and \"invalid entry encountered\" conditions.</p>\n<p>Instead, it should throw an exception if an invalid entry is encountered.</p>\n<p>I've created a test case and fix. I will submit a pull request shortly.</p>\n</div>\n"}
