{"issue_id": "CSV-75", "title": "ExtendedBufferReader does not handle EOL consistently", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>ExtendedBufferReader checks for '\\n' (LF) in the read() methods, incrementing linecount when found.</p>\n<p>However, the readLine() method calls BufferedReader.readLine() which treats CR, LF and CRLF equally (and drops them).</p>\n<p>If the code is to be flexible in what it accepts, the class should also allow for CR alone as a line terminator.</p>\n<p>It should work if the code increments the line counter for CR, and for LF if the previous character was not CR.</p>\n</div>\n"}
