{"issue_id": "1062", "title": "Operator precedence breaks with certain combinations of *, / and %.", "description": "<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. Try to compile this: x = a % b / b * c * 2; using either simple or advanced optimizations\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nExpected: probably x=a%b/b*c*2;\r\nActual: x=2*a%b/b*c; (2 is incorrectly bumped to the beginning)\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n\r\nHappens on latest version and online. By the looks of things the change occurred somewhere between versions 20111003 and 20111114.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nAs *, / and % all have the same operator precedence they should be left-to-right, but hoisting the 2 to the beginning means it's on the wrong side of the modulus operator."}
