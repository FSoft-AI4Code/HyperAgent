{"issue_id": "LANG-328", "title": "LocaleUtils.toLocale() rejects strings with only language+variant", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>LocaleUtils.toLocale() throws an exception on strings containing a language and a variant but no country code. For example : fr__POSIX</p>\n<p>This string can be produced with the JDK by instanciating a Locale with an empty string for the country : new Locale(\"fr\", \"\", \"POSIX\").toString(). According to the javadoc for the Locale class a variant is allowed with just a language code or just a country code.</p>\n<p>Commons Configuration handles this case in its PropertyConverter.toLocale() method. I'd like to replace our implementation by the one provided by LocaleUtils, but our tests fail due to this case.</p>\n</div>\n"}
