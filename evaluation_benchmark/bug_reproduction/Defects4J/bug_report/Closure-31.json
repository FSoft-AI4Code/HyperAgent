{"issue_id": "703", "title": "Add support for --manage_closure_dependencies and --only_closure_dependencies with compilation level WHITESPACE_ONLY", "description": "The compiler options --manage_closure_dependencies and --only_closure_dependencies are currently ignored with compilation level WHITESPACE_ONLY. It would be helpful for testing, if dependency management were supported for WHITESPACE_ONLY in addition to SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS and ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS. For example, both Closure Builder and plovr automatically manage dependencies for all compilation levels.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change (see attached diff) does not automatically manage dependencies, but it enables dependency management if either --manage_closure_dependencies or --only_closure_dependencies is specified, or if at least one --closure_entry_point is specified.\r\n\r\nThe attached diff passed the JUnit tests: ant test\r\n"}
