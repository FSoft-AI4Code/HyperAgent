{"issue_id": "JXPATH-94", "title": "equality test for multi-valued variables does not conform to spec", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>given e.g. variable d=</p>\n{\"a\", \"b\"}\n<p>, the spec implies that \"$d = 'a'\" and that \"$d = 'b'\".  Instead of iterating the variable's components its immediate content (here, the String[]) is compared, causing the aforementioned assertions to fail.</p>\n</div>\n"}
