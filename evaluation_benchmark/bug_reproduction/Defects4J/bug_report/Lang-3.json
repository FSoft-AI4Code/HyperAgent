{"issue_id": "LANG-693", "title": "Method createNumber from NumberUtils doesn't work for floating point numbers other than Float", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>Method createNumber from NumberUtils is trying to parse a string with a floating point number always first as a Float, that will cause that if we send a string with a number that will need a Double or even a BigDecimal the number will be truncate to accommodate into the Float without an exception to be thrown, so in fact we will no be returning ever neither a Double nor a BigDecimal.</p>\n</div>\n"}
