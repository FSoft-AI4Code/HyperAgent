{"issue_id": "CLI-203", "title": "The state of the option groups is not updated by the default options", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>The state of the option groups is neither checked nor updated when the default options passed as a Properties instance to the parse method are processed. For example if 'a' and 'b' are two mutually exclusive options, the command line argument could specify 'a' and the default options could contain 'b', the parser will not complain and the resulting CommandLine will contain 'a' and 'b'.</p>\n</div>\n"}
