{"issue_id": "695", "title": "UTF16 streams with BOM are processed as UTF-8", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">The handling of the character encoding in org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil.parseByteData(...) is bugged when the input is an UTF16 stream with unicode BOM. This method does a check for presence of a BOM and, if it finds one, incorrectly assumes that this was a UTF-8 BOM. To fix this, the code would have to check the raw BOM bytes as the distinction between the various BOMs is lost after conversion to characters.
