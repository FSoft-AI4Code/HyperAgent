{"issue_id": "MATH-996", "title": "Fraction specified with maxDenominator and a value very close to a simple fraction should not throw an overflow exception", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>An overflow exception is thrown when a Fraction is initialized with a maxDenominator from a double that is very close to a simple<br/>\nfraction.  For example:</p>\n<p>double d = 0.5000000001;<br/>\nFraction f = new Fraction(d, 10);</p>\n<p>Patch with unit test on way.</p>\n</div>\n"}
