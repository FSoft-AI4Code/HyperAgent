{"issue_id": "LANG-719", "title": "FastDateFormat formats year differently than SimpleDateFormat in Java 7", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>Starting with Java 7 does SimpleDateFormat format a year pattern of 'Y' or 'YYY' as '2003' instead of '03' as in former Java releases. According Javadoc this pattern should have been always been formatted as number, therefore the new behavior seems to be a bug fix in the JDK. FastDateFormat is adjusted to behave the same.</p>\n</div>\n"}
