{"issue_id": "803", "title": "1.10.1 failed a test while 1.8.3 passed for a contains query", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">Today I tried to upgrade jsoup from 1.8.3 to 1.10.1, however, one of my unit test failed like this:</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">\"div.a-row.a-spacing-medium span.a-size-base:contains(I'll Ship &amp; Pay)\"<br/>\n\"div.a-row.a-spacing-medium span.a-size-base:contains(I'll Send &amp; Pay)\"<br/>\n\"div.a-row.a-spacing-medium span.a-color-price:contains(Varies)\"</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Above are 3 css selectors and in a webpage that no such element exists, Jsoup selector find 9 elements, which broke my unit test. It seems like that the <strong>contains</strong> logic broke. I'm not sure whether <strong>'</strong> or <strong>&amp;</strong> processing changed in newer version.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Can you have a look at this? For your reference I've attached the html page as a zip file.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/files/676839/AmazonReturn.zip\">AmazonReturn.zip</a></p>\n"}
