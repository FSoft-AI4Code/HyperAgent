{"issue_id": "423", "title": "Closure Compiler failed to translate all instances of a function name", "description": "<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. Compile the attached jQuery Multicheck plugin using SIMPLE optimization.\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nYou expect that the function preload_check_all() gets its name translated appropriately. In fact, the Closure Compiler breaks the code by changing the function declaration but NOT changing the call to the function on line 76."}
