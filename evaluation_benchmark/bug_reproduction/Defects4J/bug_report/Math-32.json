{"issue_id": "MATH-780", "title": "BSPTree class and recovery of a Euclidean 3D BRep", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>New to the work here. Thanks for your efforts on this code.</p>\n<p>I create a BSPTree from a BoundaryRep (Brep) my test Brep is a cube as represented by a float array containing 8 3D points in(x,y,z) order and an array of indices (12 triplets for the 12 faces of the cube). I construct a BSPMesh() as shown in the code below. I can construct the PolyhedronsSet() but have problems extracting the faces from the BSPTree to reconstruct the BRep. The attached code (BSPMesh2.java) shows that a small change to 1 of the vertex positions causes/corrects the problem.</p>\n<p>Any ideas?</p>\n</div>\n"}
