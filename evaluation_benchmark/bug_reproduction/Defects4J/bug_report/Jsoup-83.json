{"issue_id": "797", "title": "Could handle missing tag ends (&gt;) better", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">We are using Jsoup to parse HTML documents from some external websites, which are not under our control. A few days ago, one of these sites updated their website, and introduced a bug, causing our crawling to fail spectacularly. The HTML which was broken looked a bit like this:</p>\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content='&lt;td class=\"my-cell\"\n   &lt;div class=\"great-formatting\"&gt;100&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;'><pre class=\"notranslate\"><code>&lt;td class=\"my-cell\"\n   &lt;div class=\"great-formatting\"&gt;100&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">As you can see, the TD is missing a closing <code class=\"notranslate\">&gt;</code>, while we did a <code class=\"notranslate\">document.select(\"div.great-formatting\")</code>. This failed, because Jsoup couldn't parse the document correctly anymore.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I understand it's a very edge case, and maybe very hard to fix. However, for us it was a production issue, and caused us quite a few headaches. Right now, we have a sort of preprocessor running over the HTML to close all elements which should be closed, but it would be much nicer if Jsoup would handle this out of the box.</p>\n"}
