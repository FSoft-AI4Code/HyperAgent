What do you see instead?</b>\nThe file should still have its goog.provide/require tags in place.\r\nInstead they are processed.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\ncurrent SVN (also tried two of the preceding binary releases with same \r\nresult)\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nFlag can't be set to false due to a missing &quot;else&quot; in the command-line \r\nparser."}
