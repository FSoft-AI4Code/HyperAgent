{"issue_id": "MATH-209", "title": "RealMatrixImpl#operate gets result vector dimensions wrong", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p><tt>org.apache.commons.math.linear.RealMatrixImpl#operate</tt> tries to create a result vector that always has the same length as the input vector. This can result in runtime exceptions if the matrix is non-square and it always yields incorrect results if the matrix is non-square. The correct behaviour would of course be to create a vector with the same length as the row dimension of the matrix.</p>\n<p>Thus line 640 in RealMatrixImpl.java should read<br/>\n<tt>double[] out = new double<span class=\"error\">[nRows]</span>;</tt><br/>\ninstead of<br/>\n<tt>double[] out = new double<span class=\"error\">[v.length]</span>;</tt></p>\n</div>\n"}
