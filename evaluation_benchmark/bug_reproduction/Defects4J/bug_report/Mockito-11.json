{"issue_id": "87", "title": "Fixed DelegatingMethod.equals() so that it's easier to extend Mockito by custom verification modes", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">Hi Szczepan,</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Thanks for the reply, I'll simplify the methods now - do I open a new pull request, or somehow edit this one?  Sorry - I'm new to GitHub and Git!</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I haven't used a custom VerificationMode in anger yet, I'm actually writing a tutorial on Mockito and wanted to show one as an example.  The one I wrote would verify that an invocation was the first invocation on a Mock, and I had a lot of hair pulling when the .equals() of my chunk and all invocations didn't evaluate to true, even though it was the same object!</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Regards,<br/>\nHugh</p>\n"}
