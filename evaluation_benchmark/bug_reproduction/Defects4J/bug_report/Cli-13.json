{"issue_id": "CLI-61", "title": "[cli] argument defaults prevent commandline usage.", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>I have found a bug in the following scenario:</p>\n<p>You have an option which can take a single argument which in turn has a default<br/>\nvalue. You supply a value on the command line which is intended to override<br/>\nthis default however as the CommandLine already has a value for this Option,<br/>\nthis second value is not allowed and the command line cannot be parsed.</p>\n<p>I have created a patch which adds a method to WritableCommandLine and its Impl<br/>\nwhich allows you to retrieve the undefaulted values for an Option. I have then<br/>\nchanged ArgumentImpl to use this method to determine the argument count</p>\n</div>\n"}
