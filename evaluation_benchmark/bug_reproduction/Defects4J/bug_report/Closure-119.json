{"issue_id": "1070", "title": "catch(e) yields JSC_UNDEFINED_NAME warning when e is used in catch in advanced mode", "description": "<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. set closure for advanced compilation\r\n2. compile this:\r\n// ==ClosureCompiler==\r\n// @compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS\r\n// @output_file_name default.js\r\n// ==/ClosureCompiler==\r\n\r\ntry {\r\nvar x = 5;\r\n}\r\ncatch(e) {\r\nvar s = &quot;FAIL&quot; + e.name + &quot;: &quot;+ e.message;\r\n}\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nI expect no warning or error for this.  Instead I see this:\r\n\r\nJSC_UNREACHABLE_CODE: unreachable code at line 4 character 0\r\ncatch(e) {\r\n^\r\nJSC_UNDEFINED_NAME: e is never defined at line 5 character 17\r\nvar s = &quot;FAIL&quot; + e.name + &quot;: &quot;+ e.message;\r\n                 ^\r\nJSC_UNDEFINED_NAME: e is never defined at line 5 character 32\r\nvar s = &quot;FAIL&quot; + e.name + &quot;: &quot;+ e.message;\r\n                                ^\r\nIn my case I'm especially complaining about the JSC_UNDEFINED_NAME warning...  Also it seems the unreachable complaint isn't right, but i'm not sure.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nI'm using this url: http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home\r\nusing chrome browser on windows: Version 28.0.1500.95 m \r\n... but this is a server side error from what I see...\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>"}
