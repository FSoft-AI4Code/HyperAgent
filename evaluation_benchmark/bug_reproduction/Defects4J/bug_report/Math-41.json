{"issue_id": "MATH-704", "title": "One of Variance.evaluate() methods does not work correctly", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>The method org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance.evaluate(double[] values, double[] weights, double mean, int begin, int length) does not work properly. Looks loke it ignores the length parameter and grabs the whole dataset.<br/>\nSimilar method in Mean class seems to work.<br/>\nI did not check other methods taking the part of the array; they may have the same problem.</p>\n<p>Workaround: I had to shrink my arrays and use the method without the length.</p>\n</div>\n"}
