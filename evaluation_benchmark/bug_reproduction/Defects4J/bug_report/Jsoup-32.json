{"issue_id": "278", "title": "Element.clone() wrongly shared a same classNames Set instance", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">In the clone() method of Node, the Object.clone() is called, if the original element's classNames Set had been initialized before clone, the original classNames Set will be set to the new cloned Element instance due to the JDK's clone mechanism. Thus, the old element and the newly cloned Element will share a same classNames Set instance.</p>\n"}
