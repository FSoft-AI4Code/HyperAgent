{"issue_id": "MATH-166", "title": "Special functions not very accurate", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>The Gamma and Beta functions return values in double precision but the default epsilon is set to 10e-9. I think that the default should be set to the highest possible accuracy, as this is what I'd expect to be returned by a double precision routine. Note that the erf function already uses a call to Gamma.regularizedGammaP with an epsilon of 1.0e-15.</p>\n</div>\n"}
