{"issue_id": "1192", "title": "Jsoup.parse method hangs for certain bogus input text", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">We are indexing the <a href=\"https://lemurproject.org/clueweb12/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ClueWeb12</a> dataset using <a href=\"https://github.com/iorixxx/lucene-clueweb-retrieval\">lucene-clueweb-retrieval</a> library. We are using JSoup to parse Web pages. After a (drop-in) upgrade to JSoup version 1.11.3, our indexing processes hanged. Note than this was not the issue for earlier version of JSoup. Using jstack we spot document(s) that cause this problem crated a failing test case using it. We understand that the input is bogus (not a html code, but a binary file), but we expect JSoup to throw an exception or return an empty string. But the program hangs and never ends. We would like to report this to the community in the hope for obtaining a fix for the issue.</p>\n"}
