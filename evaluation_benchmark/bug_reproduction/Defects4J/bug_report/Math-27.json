{"issue_id": "MATH-835", "title": "Fraction percentageValue rare overflow", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>The percentageValue() method of the Fraction class works by first multiplying the Fraction by 100, then converting the Fraction to a double. This causes overflows when the numerator is greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE/100, even when the value of the fraction is far below this value.</p>\n<p>The patch changes the method to first convert to a double value, and then multiply this value by 100 - the result should be the same, but with less overflows. An addition to the test for the method that covers this bug is also included.</p>\n</div>\n"}
