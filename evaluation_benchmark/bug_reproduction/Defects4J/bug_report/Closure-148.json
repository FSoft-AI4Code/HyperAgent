{"issue_id": "196", "title": "CSS3 'writingMode' not recognised in advanced mode", "description": "element.style.writingMode was defined in CSS3 but later dropped. However it is supported by IE7 (possibly earlier). It's a useful way to achieve vertical text in IE.\r\n\r\nClosure Compiler will change references of element.style.writingMode to element.style.a, breaking implementation.\r\n\r\nI've attached a patch adding this to the IE css properties.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJake."}
