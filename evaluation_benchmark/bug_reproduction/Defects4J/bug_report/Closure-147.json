What do you see instead?</b>\nSince the 0514 release warned in in the &quot;write&quot; case above I would expect the 0616 to also report this. \r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nAs said above, 20100514 and 20100616 releases.\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nI understand that the status is that inline-notation isn't preferred, though I wouldn't expect a previous, correct, warning to disappear. (Since I reported issue #144 I'm also aware of the previous limitation in global this)."}
