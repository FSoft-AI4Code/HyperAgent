{"issue_id": "821", "title": "Wrong code generated if mixing types in ternary operator", "description": "<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. Use Google Closure Compiler to compile this code:\r\n\r\n    var a =(Math.random()&gt;0.5? '1' : 2 ) + 3 + 4;\r\n\r\nYou can either simple or advanced. It doesn't matter\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nI'm seeing this as a result:\r\n    var a = (0.5 &lt; Math.random() ? 1 : 2) + 7;\r\n\r\nThis is obviously wrong as the '1' string literal got converted to a number, and 3+4 got combined into 7 while that's not ok as '1' + 3 + 4 = '134', not '17'.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nSeems like this issue happens only when you are mixing types together. If both 1 and 2 are string literals or if they are both numbers it won't happen. I was also a little surprised to see this happening in simple mode as it actually breaks the behavior."}
