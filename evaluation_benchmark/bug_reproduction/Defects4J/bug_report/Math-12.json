{"issue_id": "MATH-927", "title": "GammaDistribution cloning broken", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>Serializing a GammaDistribution and deserializing it, does not result in a cloned distribution that produces the same samples.</p>\n<p>Cause: GammaDistribution inherits from AbstractRealDistribution, which implements Serializable. AbstractRealDistribution has random, in which we have a Well19937c instance, which inherits from AbstractWell. AbstractWell implements Serializable. AbstractWell inherits from BitsStreamGenerator, which is not Serializable, but does have a private field 'nextGaussian'.</p>\n<p>Solution: Make BitStreamGenerator implement Serializable as well.</p>\n<p>This probably affects other distributions as well.</p>\n</div>\n"}
