{"issue_id": "537", "title": "Prototype methods can't be used from the constructor in case prototype is explicitly defined.", "description": "Consider the following source code:\r\nhttp://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/inspector/front-end/DOMAgent.js\r\n\r\nWhen I mark WebInspector.DOMAgent as a @constructor, I get the following warning.\r\n\r\nSource/WebCore/inspector/front-end/DOMAgent.js:48: WARNING - Property _setAttributesPayload never defined on WebInspector.DOMNode\r\n        this._setAttributesPayload(payload.attributes);\r\n\r\nIt sounds like the problem is in the way we define prototypes in line 83-ish. That's the way WebKit style tells us to do.\r\n"}
