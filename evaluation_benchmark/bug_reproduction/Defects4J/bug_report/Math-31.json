{"issue_id": "MATH-718", "title": "inverseCumulativeProbability of BinomialDistribution returns wrong value for large trials.", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>The inverseCumulativeProbability method of the BinomialDistributionImpl class returns wrong value for large trials.  Following code will be reproduce the problem.</p>\n<p><tt>System.out.println(new BinomialDistributionImpl(1000000, 0.5).inverseCumulativeProbability(0.5));</tt></p>\n<p>This returns 499525, though it should be 499999.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how it should be fixed, but the cause is that the cumulativeProbability method returns Infinity, not NaN.  As the result the checkedCumulativeProbability method doesn't work as expected.</p>\n</div>\n"}
