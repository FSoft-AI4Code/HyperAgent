We should deprecate these<br/>\nproperties from the RealDistribution interface, but since removal<br/>\nwill have to wait until 4.0, we should agree on a precise<br/>\ndefinition and fix the code to match it in the mean time.</p>\n<p>The definition that I propose is that isSupportXxxInclusive means<br/>\nthat when the density function is applied to the upper or lower<br/>\nbound of support returned by getSupportXxxBound, a finite (i.e. not<br/>\ninfinite), not NaN value is returned.</p>\n<p><span class=\"error\">[1]</span> <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://markmail.org/message/dxuxh7eybl7xejde\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://markmail.org/message/dxuxh7eybl7xejde</a></p>\n</div>\n"}
