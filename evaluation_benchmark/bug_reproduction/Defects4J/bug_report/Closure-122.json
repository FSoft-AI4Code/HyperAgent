{"issue_id": "1037", "title": "Inconsistent handling of non-JSDoc comments", "description": "<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n<b>1.</b>\n<b>2.</b>\n<b>3.</b>\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nWhen given:\r\n\r\n    /* @preserve Foo License */\r\n    alert(&quot;foo&quot;);\r\n\r\nIt spits out:\r\n\r\n    stdin:1: WARNING - Parse error. Non-JSDoc comment has annotations. Did you mean to start it with '/**'?\r\n    /* @license Foo License */\r\n    ^\r\n    \r\n    0 error(s), 1 warning(s)\r\n    alert(&quot;foo&quot;);\r\n\r\nIf I take the suggestion and change the opening of the comment to '/**', everything is great.  However, if I change it to '/*!', the warning goes away, but it doesn't preserve the comment either.\r\n\r\nI expect it to print the above warning, or preserve the comment.  That it does neither when starting with &quot;/*!&quot; (and every other character I tried) is confusing.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using?
