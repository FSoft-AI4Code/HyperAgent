{"issue_id": "MATH-864", "title": "CMAESOptimizer does not enforce bounds", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>The CMAESOptimizer can exceed the bounds passed to optimize.  Looking at the generationLoop in doOptimize(), it does a bounds check by calling isFeasible() but if checkFeasableCount is zero (the default) then isFeasible() is never even called.  Also, even with non-zero checkFeasableCount it may give up before finding an in-bounds offspring and go forward with an out-of-bounds offspring.  This is against svn revision 1387637.  I can provide an example program where the optimizer ends up with a fit outside the prescribed bounds if that would help.</p>\n</div>\n"}
