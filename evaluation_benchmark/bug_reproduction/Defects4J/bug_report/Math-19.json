{"issue_id": "MATH-865", "title": "Wide bounds to CMAESOptimizer result in NaN parameters passed to fitness function", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>If you give large values as lower/upper bounds (for example -Double.MAX_VALUE as a lower bound), the optimizer can call the fitness function with parameters set to NaN.  My guess is this is due to FitnessFunction.encode/decode generating NaN when normalizing/denormalizing parameters.  For example, if the difference between the lower and upper bound is greater than Double.MAX_VALUE, encode could divide infinity by infinity.</p>\n</div>\n"}
