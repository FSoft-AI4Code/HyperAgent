Target versions are <code class=\"notranslate\">2.8.10</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">2.9.1</code> -- it is possible to backport in 2.7 and even 2.6, but there is diminishing return on effort with those versions so it will not happen unless specifically requested (I'm happy to merge PRs).</p>\n"}
