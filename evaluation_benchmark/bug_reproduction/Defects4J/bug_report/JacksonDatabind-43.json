{"issue_id": "1150", "title": "Problem with Object id handling, explicit <code>null</code> token", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">I'd like bit more explanation here, as well as unit test showing in what cases should this be a problem.<br/>\nDeserializers are typically never called with null tokens, as it is caller's responsibility to handle that (for root value handling it's mapper/reader, for POJO/Collection/Map properties, deserializer for that structured type)</p>\n"}
