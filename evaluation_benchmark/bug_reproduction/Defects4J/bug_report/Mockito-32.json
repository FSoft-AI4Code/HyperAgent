{"issue_id": "216", "title": "Mockito can't create mock on public class that extends package-private class", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">I created simple project to demonstrate this:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/astafev/mockito-package-private-class/\">https://github.com/astafev/mockito-package-private-class/</a></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Please take a look. Even if it can't be implemented, I think that mockito should throw some normal exception at time of creation.<br/>\nIn my variant on first creation it returns wrong-working mock (invokes real method instead of stubbed). On second creation throws exception that doesn't really connected with problem.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Everything works fine if you mock package-private parent.</p>\n"}
