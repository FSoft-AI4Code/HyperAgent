{"issue_id": "103", "title": "$super is replaced when it should not be replaced", "description": "<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. Have javascript using prototype's $super\r\n2. Compile with advanced_optimizations\r\n3. See that $super is replaced by for example $super$$4\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\n$super should not be renamed as it is used by prototype.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nLatest from svn.\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nPersonally I made a quick fix in MakeDeclaredNamesUnique.java line 79:\r\nif (t.getCompiler().getCodingConvention().isExported(name)) { continue; }\r\nThis fixed it for me, but not sure if that's the right place or method to\r\nsolve this, as I am unfamiliar with the project."}
