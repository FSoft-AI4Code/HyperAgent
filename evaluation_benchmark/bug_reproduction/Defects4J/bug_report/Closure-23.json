{"issue_id": "747", "title": "tryFoldArrayAccess does not check for side effects", "description": "<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. Compile the following program with simple or advanced optimization:\r\nconsole.log([console.log('hello, '), 'world!'][1]);\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nThe expected output would preserve side effects. It would not transform the program at all or transform it into:\r\n\r\nconsole.log((console.log(&quot;hello&quot;), &quot;world!&quot;));\r\n\r\nInstead, the program is transformed into:\r\n\r\nconsole.log(&quot;world!&quot;);\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\nRevision 2022. Ubuntu 12.04.\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\ntryFoldArrayAccess in com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants should check whether   every array element that is not going to be preserved has no side effects."}
