What do you see instead?</b>\n\r\nI expect minified code, but an error is thrown instead.\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\n\r\nappspot\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\n\r\nDivision by zero is a perfectly sane operation in ECMAScript. See 11.5.2 [0] of the ECMAScript 5 specification. Aliased division by zero `(n=1)/0` is permitted.\r\n\r\n[0] http://es5.github.com/#x11.5.2"}
