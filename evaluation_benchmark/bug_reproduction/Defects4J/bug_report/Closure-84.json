{"issue_id": "215", "title": "Invalid left-hand side of assignment not detected", "description": "<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\nCompile this:\r\n  var x=0,y=1;x||y=8\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nI expect an error, because this is parsed as (x||y)=8, which is an invalid left-hand side of an assignment. Instead, I get\r\n  var x=0,y=1;x||y=8;\r\nwhich, like the input, is invalid code."}
