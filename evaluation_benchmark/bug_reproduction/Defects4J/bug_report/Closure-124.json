{"issue_id": "1017", "title": "Different output from RestAPI and command line jar", "description": "When I compile using the jar file from the command line I get a result that is not correct. However, when I test it via the REST API or the Web UI I get a correct output. I've attached a file with the code that we are compiling.\r\n\r\n<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>\n1. Compile the attached file with &quot;java -jar compiler.jar --js test.js&quot;\r\n2. Compile the content of the attached file on http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home\r\n3. Compare the output, note how the following part is converted in the two cases:\r\n\r\n&quot;var foreignObject = gfx.parentNode.parentNode;\r\nvar parentContainer = foreignObject.parentNode.parentNode;&quot;\r\n\r\n<b>What is the expected output? What do you see instead?</b>\nThe Web UI converts the lines into: if(b){if(a=b.parentNode.parentNode,b=a.parentNode.parentNode,null!==b)\r\nThe command line converts it into: var b=a=a.parentNode.parentNode;\r\nThe Web UI results in correct code, the other results in code that tries to do &quot;c.appendChild(b)&quot; with c = b (c=a=a.parentNode.parentNode)\r\n\r\n<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>\ncompiler.jar: v20130411-90-g4e19b4e\r\nMac OSX 10.8.3\r\nJava: java 1.6.0_45\r\n\r\n<b>Please provide any additional information below.</b>\nWe are also using the compiler form within our java code, with the same result.\r\nWeb UI was called with:\r\n// ==ClosureCompiler==\r\n// @compilation_level SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS\r\n// @output_file_name default.js\r\n// ==/ClosureCompiler=="}
