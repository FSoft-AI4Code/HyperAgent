{"issue_id": "CLI-13", "title": "[cli] CommandLine.getOptionValue() behaves contrary to docs", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>Hi</p>\n<p>If I have:</p>\n<p>final String debugOpt = \"debug\";<br/>\n\tOption debug = OptionBuilder<br/>\n\t    .withArgName(debugOpt)<br/>\n\t    .withDescription(\"turn on debugging\")<br/>\n\t    .withLongOpt(debugOpt)<br/>\n\t    .create('d');</p>\n<p>and then later I do:</p>\n<p>String dbg = commandLine.getOptionValue(debugOpt);</p>\n<p>then dbg will be null. Instead, I have to use getOptionValue('d'). This seems<br/>\ncontrary to the docs (see bottom of<br/>\n<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cli/usage.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/cli/usage.html</a>), which implies that I should<br/>\nbe able to query the commandLine object using a full string, rather than just<br/>\nthe string's first character.</p>\n<p>Can I suggest that the API of OptionBuilder be made clearer so that it is<br/>\nobvious that you can have long and short option names---perhaps make the<br/>\ncreate() method take no arguments (thus forcing long and short arg names to be<br/>\nset explicitly). (Also, there seems to be some confusion between the terms<br/>\n'argument' and 'option' in the API, but perhaps that is just me).</p>\n<p>Also, I would hop to be able to query commandLine by either a single char or an<br/>\nentire string, as suggested by the docs.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Chris</p>\n</div>\n"}
