{"issue_id": "MATH-924", "title": "new multivariate vector optimizers cannot be used with large number of weights", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>When using the Weigth class to pass a large number of weights to multivariate vector optimizers, an nxn full matrix is created (and copied) when a n elements vector is used. This exhausts memory when n is large.</p>\n<p>This happens for example when using curve fitters (even simple curve fitters like polynomial ones for low degree) with large number of points. I encountered this with curve fitting on 41200 points, which created a matrix with 1.7 billion elements.</p>\n</div>\n"}
