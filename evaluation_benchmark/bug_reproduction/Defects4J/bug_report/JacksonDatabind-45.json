{"issue_id": "1155", "title": "Fix for #1154", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">Looks pretty good, but would it be possible to have a unit test that would fail before fix, pass after? Would be great to have something to guard against regression.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">I may want to change the logic a little bit, however; if shape is explicitly defined as <code class=\"notranslate\">NUMBER</code>, textual representation should not be enabled even if <code class=\"notranslate\">Locale</code> (etc) happen to be specified: explicit shape value should have precedence. I can make that change, or you can do it, either way is fine.<br/>\nI'll also need to merge this again 2.7 branch instead of master, to get in 2.7.3.</p>\n"}
