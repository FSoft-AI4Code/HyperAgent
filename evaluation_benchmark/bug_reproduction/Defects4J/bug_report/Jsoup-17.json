{"issue_id": "107", "title": "Cleaning a fragment with just \"0\" returns an empty string (1.6.0)", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">When using JSoup to sanitize some fragments that are inserted into another document, I noticed if a text node contains just the \"0\", it ends up cleaning it as just 0.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The root of this seems to come from TreeBuilderState's methods, in such places like InBody and InSelect; when it checks for type Character, it seems to cause the \"0\" token to equal the nullstring; this shouldn't be the case, as character 0 is not the same as a \"null\" character.</p>\n"}
