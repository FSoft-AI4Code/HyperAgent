{"issue_id": "1735", "title": "Missing type checks when using polymorphic type ids", "description": "\n<p dir=\"auto\">(report by Lukes Euler)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><code class=\"notranslate\">JavaType</code> supports limited amount of generic typing for textual representation, originally just to support typing needed for <code class=\"notranslate\">EnumMap</code> (I think). Based on some reports, it appears that some of type compatibility checks are not performed in those cases; if so, they should be made since there is potential for abuse.<br/>\nThe problem here although actual type assignment will fail later on, ability to trigger some of processing (instantiation of incompatible classes, perhaps assingnment of properties) may itself be vulnerability.</p>\n"}
