{"issue_id": "COMPRESS-187", "title": "ZipArchiveInputStream and ZipFile don't produce equals ZipArchiveEntry instances", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>I'm trying to use a ZipArchiveEntry coming from ZipArchiveInputStream that I stored somwhere for later with a ZipFile and it does not work.</p>\n<p>The reason is that it can't find the ZipArchiveEntry in the ZipFile entries map. It is exactly the same zip file but both entries are not equals so the Map#get fail.</p>\n<p>As far as I can see the main difference is that <tt>comment</tt> is null in ZipArchiveInputStream while it's en empty string in ZipFile. I looked at ZipArchiveInputStream and it looks like the comment (whatever it is) is simply not parsed while I can find some code related to the comment at the end of ZIipFile#readCentralDirectoryEntry.</p>\n<p>Note that java.util.zip does not have this issue. Did not checked what they do but the zip entries are equals.</p>\n</div>\n"}
