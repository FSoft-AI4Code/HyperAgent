{"issue_id": "COMPRESS-335", "title": "TAR checksum fails when checksum is right aligned", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>The linked TAR has a checksum with zero padding on the left instead of the expected <tt>NULL-SPACE</tt> terminator on the right. As a result the last two digits of the stored checksum are lost and the otherwise valid checksum is treated as invalid.</p>\n<p>Given that the code already checks for digits being in range before adding them to the stored sum, is it necessary to only look at the first 6 octal digits instead of the whole field?</p>\n</div>\n"}
