{"issue_id": "MATH-679", "title": "Integer overflow in OpenMapRealMatrix", "description": "\n<div class=\"user-content-block\">\n<p>computeKey() has an integer overflow. Since it is a sparse matrix, this is quite easily encountered long before heap space is exhausted. The attached code demonstrates the problem, which could potentially be a security vulnerability (for example, if one was to use this matrix to store access control information).</p>\n<p>Workaround: never create an OpenMapRealMatrix with more cells than are addressable with an int.</p>\n</div>\n"}
