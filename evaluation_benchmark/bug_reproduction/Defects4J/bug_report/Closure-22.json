{"issue_id": "753", "title": "Classify non-rightmost expressions as problematic", "description": "<b>Purpose of code changes:</b>\nWhen it comes to an expression involving the comma operator, only the\r\nfirst element of such a sequence is checked for being free of side\r\neffects. If the element is free of side effects, it is classified as\r\nproblematic and a warning is issued.\r\n\r\nAs other non-rightmost elements are not checked for being free of side\r\neffects and therefore cannot be classified as problematic, this leads\r\nto unexpected behavior:\r\n\r\n1. foo((1, 2, 42)) is transformed into foo((1, 3)) and a warning is\r\nissued only with regard to the first element.\r\n2. foo((bar(), 2, 42)) is transformed into foo((bar(), 3)) and no\r\nwarning is issued.\r\n3. foo(((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 42))) is transformed into foo((1, 4, 42)) and\r\nwarnings are issued with regard to the first elements of inner\r\nsequences only."}
