## Overview

HyperAgent is a generalist multi-agent system designed to tackle a wide spectrum of software engineering (SE) tasks across various programming languages. Unlike existing LLM-based software agents that typically specialize in specific tasks, HyperAgent mimics human developers' workflows to address diverse SE challenges. Comprising four specialized agents (Planner, Navigator, Code Editor, and Executor), it manages the full lifecycle of SE tasks from conception to verification. 

HyperAgent demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in:

- GitHub issue resolution ([SWE-Bench-Python](https://www.swebench.com/))
- Repository-level code generation ([RepoExec-Python](https://github.com/FSoft-AI4Code/RepoExec))
- Fault localization and program repair ([Defects4J-Java](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j))

Notably, HyperAgent is designed to handle a codebase written in a wide range of programming languages. We currently support Python and Java and plan to expand to other languages on other tasks/benchmarks in the future. We believe we are the first software engineering agent designed to handle a variety of software engineering tasks across multiple programming languages.

### Key Features
- Generalizability: Easily adapts to various tasks with minimal configuration changes.
- Efficiency: Optimized agents manage processes of varying complexity using appropriate LLM capabilities.
- Scalability: Built to handle large-scale, real-world software engineering scenarios effectively.
- Multi-task Proficiency: Excels in GitHub issue resolution, code generation, fault localization, and program repair. existing development workflow with its Python API, allowing for flexible and powerful code interactions.

RepoExec Results Comparison: HyperAgent-Lite-3 achieves comparable or superior performance to models provided with full context, particularly in Pass@5 (53.33%). It outperforms RAG-based models, demonstrating effective automatic context retrieval from codebases. This highlights the potential of end-to-end solutions like \methodnamews in real-world scenarios where manual context provision is impractical.

### Fault Localization on Defects4J
| Method            | Acc@1        | Cost ($) |
|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| Ochiai            | 20.25%       | --       |
| DeepFL            | 33.90%       | --       |

| **HyperAgent-Lite-1** | **59.70%**   | 0.18     |

Comparison of Acc@1 across Different Fault Localization Methods on the Defects4J dataset. \methodnamews-Lite-1 significantly outperforms all baselines, achieving 59.70% accuracy on this widely-used benchmark. It surpasses the next best method, AutoFL, by 8.7 percentage points, and more than doubles the performance of traditional methods like Dstar and Ochiai. This demonstrates the effectiveness of \methodnamews's approach in precisely locating faults on the first attempt in real-world Java projects, potentially reducing debugging time and effort for developers.

Results on Defects4J dataset comparing HyperAgent with other repair tools. The table includes the number of bugs, and for HyperAgent, both plausible and correct fixes. For RepairAgent, ITER, and SelfAPR, only the number of correct fixes is shown. Note that ITER does not have results for Defects4Jv2. HyperAgent achieves the best performance with 249 plausible fixes and 192 correct fixes (highlighted in blue).

## Installation and Usage
HyperAgent uses Zoekt for code search. Please install Zoekt before installing HyperAgent. Zoekt requires latest Go installation, please follow the instructions [here](https://www.linuxedo.com/2021/10/install-latest-golang-on-linux.html) to install Go.

```bash
go get github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt/

# Install Zoekt Index
go install github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt/cmd/zoekt-index
# Install Zoekt Web Server
go install github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt/cmd/zoekt-webserver
```
We also need to install universal-ctags for semantic code search. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/doc/dev/how-to/zoekt_local_dev.md#install-ctags). Remember to set the environment variable of CTAGS `CTAGS_COMMAND=universal-ctags`. 

After installing Zoekt and universal-ctags, we can install HyperAgent by running the following commands, notes that it's a must to create a new conda environment before installing HyperAgent named hyperagent, since the Executor uses jupyter kernel named hyperagent to execute the code:
```bash
conda create -n hyperagent python=3.10
pip3 install -e .
```

### Quick Test
To test the hyperagent with general prompt, you can run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py --repo "your/path/to/repo" --commit "commit_hash" --language "python" --clone_dir "data/repos" --prompt "I want to create an FastAPI app to handle GET request from OpenAI API"
```
### General usage
```python
from hyperagent import HyperAgent
pilot = HyperAgent(repo, commit=commit, language=language, clone_dir="data/repos")
```
with `repo` is the repository URL, `commit` is the commit hash, `language` is the programming language of the repository, and `clone_dir` is the directory to store the cloned repository. You also can configure the agents by setting the `config` parameter. 

Hyperagent supports 2 modes: patch and predict. In the patch mode, the agent will generate a patch for the given task. In the predict mode, the agent will predict the next token for the given task (for example, repoQA or fault location).

```python
config = {
        "name": "claude",
        "nav": [{
            "model": "claude-3-haiku-20240307",
            "api_key": os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
            "stop_sequences": ["\nObservation:"],
            "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com",
            "api_type": "anthropic",
        }],
        "edit": [{
            "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
            "api_key": os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
            "stop_sequences": ["\nObservation:"],
            "price": [0.003, 0.015],
            "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com",
            "api_type": "anthropic",
        }],
        "exec": [{
            "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
            "api_type": os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
            "stop_sequences": ["\nObservation:"],
            "price": [0.003, 0.015],
            "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com",
            "api_type": "anthropic",
        }],
        "plan": [{
            "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
            "api_type": os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
            "price": [0.003, 0.015],
            "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com",
            "api_type": "anthropic",
        }],
        "type": "patch"
    }
```

HyperAgent is a software generalist agent, therefore it can be used to solve various software engineering tasks. We provide a few examples of how to use HyperAgent to solve different tasks in the `scripts` folder. This is easily configured via an input template prompt for each task.

For example, in `src/hyperagent/tasks/github_issue_resolution.py`, we provide a script to resolve GitHub issues using HyperAgent. The script will prompt the user to input the issue title and description, and then HyperAgent will generate a patch to resolve the issue. 
```python
def run(self, system, idx) -> Result:
      prompt = self.construct_prompt(idx)
      system.query_codebase(prompt)
      prediction_patch = extract_patch(system.repo_dir)
      return prediction_patch
```

If you want to use HyperAgent to solve other tasks and systematically evaluate the results, you can create a new task class and implement the `run` method. The `run` method should return the result of the task. 

## Reproduction
To reproduce the results, please follow the instructions in the `scripts` folder. We provide the scripts to reproduce the results on SWE-Bench, RepoExec, and Defects4J datasets.

### SWE-Bench
```bash
python3 scripts/run_swe_bench.py --split "test"
```

### Fault Localization
```bash
python3 scripts/run_defects4j_fl.py
```

### Program Repair
```bash
python3 scripts/run_defects4j_apr.py
```
