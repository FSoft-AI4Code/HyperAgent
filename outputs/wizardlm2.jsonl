{"full_output": "After a thorough investigation, I identified that the DPI issue was not directly related to the `__setstate__` method of the `Figure` class or the `FigureCanvasMacOSX` class. Instead, the problem seemed to be in the way the DPI was handled during the unpickling process, which could potentially affect any backend.\n\nThe solution was to ensure that the DPI was correctly set after unpickling by adding a custom `__setstate__` method to the `FigureCanvasBase` class, which is the base class for all figure canvases. This method resets the `_device_pixel_ratio` to its default value and explicitly sets the DPI of the figure to its original value, preventing the doubling of the DPI.\n\nThis approach was chosen because it addresses the root cause of the issue by ensuring that the state of the figure after unpickling accurately reflects its state before pickling, particularly with respect to the DPI property. The `__setstate__` method is the standard way of restoring an object's state in Python, and by ensuring that the DPI is set correctly within this method, we can prevent the `OverflowError` that occurs when the DPI value becomes too large.\n\nThe patch was generated for the `FigureCanvasBase` class, which will affect all subclasses, ensuring that the fix is robust and applicable to all backends, not just the MacOSX backend.

The error is a `ValueError` related to the conversion of a long integer to base 16, suggesting a problem with the serialization/deserialization of the float object between Python versions.
