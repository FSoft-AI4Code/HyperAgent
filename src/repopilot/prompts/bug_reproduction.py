### Title: 
Interleaving of Multiple Classes and Functions Causing Error in Astropy

### Description:
While using the Astropy Python library, I encountered an error that seems to be caused by the interleaving of multiple classes and functions. The error is not isolated to a single function or class but appears to be a result of the interaction between several of them.
I have used io.fits to open a FITS file and convert it to an Astropy Table. However, when I attempt to perform operations on the table (e.g., filtering, sorting, etc.), an error is thrown.

### Expected Behavior:
The FITS data should be successfully converted into an Astropy Table, and operations such as filtering and sorting should be performed without any issues.

### Actual Behavior:
An error is thrown when attempting to perform operations on the table. The error message is not specific to a single function or class but seems to be a result of the interaction between several classes and functions.

### Error Message:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "astropy/table/table.py", line 2937, in sort
    ...
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Row' and 'Row'
```

### Additional Context:
The error seems to occur when the FITS file contains certain types of data (e.g., complex numbers, arrays, etc.). It is not clear whether the issue is with the way the data is loaded, the way it is converted to a table, or the operations performed on the table.

This issue is critical as it prevents any further data manipulation and analysis using the Astropy Table. Any help in resolving this would be greatly appreciated.

Plan:
1. Finding related functions and classes such as fits, Table, Row using code search. Find the sort function or method, it seems to be in astropy/table/table.py.
2. Find the co-occurrence of the fits opening a file and Table in the codebase, to understand how the data is loaded and converted to a table.
