<Important!>Please make the plan the minimum number of steps required (no more than 4 steps), nomarlly 2-3 steps are enough. The step should hint which set of tools to be used to accurately complete the task. 
If the information in the query is uncleared, consider use get tree structure to get overview folder structure then exlpore.
At the end of your plan, say '<END_OF_PLAN>'. If the question only cares about some specific, simple information, you can generate 2 steps plan, the first step is to find the information using semantic code search and the second step is to respond to the question."
