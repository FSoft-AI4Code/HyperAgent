MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO INTELLICODE EXTENSION

MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO CODE INTELLICODE EXTENSION

MICROSOFT AZURE DATA STUDIO INTELLICODE EXTENSION

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the above-named software (which includes, but is not limited to, any code and data provided) and any updates to the software, except to the extent those have additional terms.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.
1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 
a.	You may install and use any number of copies of the software to use solely with Microsoft Visual Studio family of products and Microsoft Azure Data Studio.

b.	Online Services in the Software. Some features of the software make use of online services to provide you information about updates to the software or extensions, or to enable you to retrieve content, collaborate with others, or otherwise supplement your development experience. As used throughout this agreement, the term “software” includes these online service features, and by using them, you consent to the transmission of information as described in Section 4, DATA.
2.	VISUAL STUDIO INTELLICODE SERVICE
a.	Coding Assistive Services.  Some coding assistive services are trained on publicly available open source code.  These services will enable you to receive, for example, AI-assisted IntelliSense suggestions for common types and components, and example usage samples for function call names.  You may use the coding assistive services, in whole or in part, only with the software (i.e., Visual Studio IntelliCode extension or the Visual Studio Code IntelliCode extension). 

b.	If you hover over a line of code in your application, coding assistance services will display code strings of supported function calls available through the coding assistance service that are also present in your current code file.  Coding assistive services will retrieve snippets from publicly available open source code showing how others are using those same functions.
3.	THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the notices file(s) accompanying the software.

4.	DATA. 
a. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the software documentation. There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoft’s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at https://aka.ms/privacy. You can learn more about data collection and its use from the software documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices. 

b. Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com//legal/gdpr.

5.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. For example, if Microsoft technically limits or disables extensibility for the software, you may not extend the software by, among other things, loading or injecting into the software any non-Microsoft add-ins, macros, or packages; modifying the software registry settings; or adding features or functionality equivalent to that found in other Visual Studio products. You may not: 

• work around any technical limitations in the software; 
• reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included with the software; 
• remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software; 
• use the software in any way that is against the law; 
• share, publish, rent or lease the software; or 
• provide the software as a stand-alone offering or combined with any of your applications for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

6.	UPDATES. The software, including all models, may periodically check for updates and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice.

7.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit (aka.ms/exporting).

8.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Because the software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.

9.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

10.	APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington State law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.

11.	CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you: 

a. Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights. 

b. Canada. If you acquired the software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software. 

c. Germany and Austria. 

(i) Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software. 

(ii) Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law. Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

12.	LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

13.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

14.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. This limitation applies to 

(a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and 

(b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law. It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
